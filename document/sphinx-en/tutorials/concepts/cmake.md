# CMake in AimRT


AimRT uses native standard Modern CMake for building and relies on CMake FetchContent to obtain dependencies.

## Modern CMake
Modern CMake is the mainstream build method for current C++ projects. It adopts an object-oriented build approach, introducing concepts such as Target and properties, which can encapsulate all parameter information including dependencies. This greatly simplifies dependency management, making the construction of large systems more organized and easier. The AimRT framework is built using Modern CMake, where each leaf folder is a CMake Target. When libraries reference each other, all lower-level dependencies are automatically handled.

For detailed usage of Modern CMake, we will not elaborate here. You can refer to some other tutorials:
- [CMake official website](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_library.html)

## AimRT's Third-Party Dependency Management Strategy

When you plan to reference/build AimRT from source, you need to understand AimRT's third-party dependency management strategy:
- AimRT uses CMake FetchContent to pull dependencies. For detailed usage of CMake FetchContent, please refer to [CMake official documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html).
- AimRT defaults to downloading from the official download addresses of each third-party dependency. If you want to download these dependencies through a custom download address, you can refer to the code in `cmake/GetXXX.cmake`, and pass the `-DXXX_DOWNLOAD_URL` parameter during the build to change the download URL to your custom address.
- If your build environment cannot connect to the external network, you can also download these dependencies offline, then refer to the code in `cmake/GetXXX.cmake`, and pass the `-DXXX_LOCAL_SOURCE` parameter during the build to change the dependency search path to your specified local address.
- If the above methods still do not meet your custom dependency management needs, you can also directly customize the code in `cmake/GetXXX.cmake`, as long as the CMake Target required for AimRT's build is introduced.
- Please note that AimRT only verifies the versions of each third-party dependency configured in the default parameters. If you need to upgrade or downgrade these third-party dependency versions, please ensure compatibility and stability on your own.


During the build process, most dependencies in AimRT are downloaded from github by default. Some dependencies, such as Boost, are large in size. If the download fails due to network issues, you can consider using the gitee alternative download address provided by AimRT.

On the linux platform, you can refer to the {{ '[url_cn.bashrc]({}/url_cn.bashrc)'.format(code_site_root_path_url) }} file to set the alternative download address as the environment variable `AIMRT_DOWNLOAD_FLAGS`. Users can add this environment variable to the CMake generation command to download from the alternative address.

To use the alternative download address, you need to first `source url_cn.bashrc`, then add the `AIMRT_DOWNLOAD_FLAGS` environment variable when generating with CMake:

```bash
# Set AIMRT_DOWNLOAD_FLAGS to download from mirror site
source url_cn.bashrc
# Add AIMRT_DOWNLOAD_FLAGS to cmake generate command
cmake -Bbuild ... $AIMRT_DOWNLOAD_FLAGS
```



## AimRT's CMake Options
The AimRT framework consists of its interface layer, runtime core, plus multiple plugins and tools. During the build, you can choose to build some or all of them by configuring CMake options. The detailed list of CMake options is as follows:
