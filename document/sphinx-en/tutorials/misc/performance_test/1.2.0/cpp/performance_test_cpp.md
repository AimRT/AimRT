# AimRT 1.2.0-cpp &nbsp;Performance Test Report

## Preface

AimRT's communication layer is implemented via plugins. Officially supported backends include Iceoryx, ROS2, Zenoh, Net, Grpc, Mqtt, etc., covering common edge and cloud communication scenarios. These plugins provide `publish-subscribe (Channel)` and `request-response (Rpc)` communication patterns to enable multi-process communication both `locally` and `across machines`.

## Test Environment

- System Environment:

  - OS: 6.1.59-rt16 x86_64 GNU/Linux
  - CPU: 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1350P
  - Total / Available Memory: 62Gi / 38Gi

- Software Environment:
  - AimRT Version: 1.2.0
