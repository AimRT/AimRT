**record_playback_plugin** is used for recording and playback of Channel data. The plugin supports loading independent type_support_pkg and supports multiple working modes such as immediate mode and signal trigger mode; it also supports frame extraction for a single topic.

Immediate mode: Start saving to disk immediately after the program starts;
Signal trigger mode: Only start saving to disk after receiving an RPC request for "start saving"; each request creates a new folder by default.

When in use, the plugin will register one or more Channel Subscribers or Publishers according to the configuration, subscribing to data to store in the database, or reading data from the database for publishing. Additionally, the plugin registers an RPC based on the protobuf protocol definition, providing some interfaces for signal trigger mode. Please note that **record_playback_plugin** does not provide any communication backend, so the signal trigger functionality generally needs to be used together with the RPC backend of other communication plugins, such as the http RPC backend in [net_plugin](./net_plugin.md).

Note that in **record_playback_plugin**, recording and playback actions are managed in units of `action`; each recording/playback `action` can have its own mode, thread, bag path, and other parameters, and can also be triggered independently. When using it, you can allocate reasonable resources for each action based on the actual data size and frequency.

`record_playback_plugin` supports persisting to the `mcap` format and allows configuring compression mode and compression level; refer to [mcap default persistence parameters](https://github.com/foxglove/mcap/blob/releases/cpp/v1.4.0/cpp/mcap/include/mcap/writer.hpp). To be compatible with `plotjuggler 3.9.1` visualization, when persisting data to `mcap`, both `publish time` and `log time` are set to the value of `log time`.

Below is a simple example configuration for signal-triggered recording:

## RecordPlaybackService

In {{ '[record_playback.proto]({}/src/protocols/plugins/record_playback_plugin/record_playback.proto)'.format(code_site_root_path_url) }}, a `RecordPlaybackService` is defined, providing the following interfaces:
- **StartRecord**: Start recording;
- **StopRecord**: Stop recording;
- **StartPlayback**: Start playback;
- **StopPlayback**: Stop playback;
- **UpdateMetadata**: Update the `ext_attributes` field of the recording package;

### StartRecord


The `StartRecord` interface is used to start a signal-mode record action. Its interface definition is as follows:

```proto
message StartRecordReq {
  string action_name = 1;
  uint32 preparation_duration_s = 2;
  uint32 record_duration_s = 3;  // record forever if value is 0
}

message CommonRsp {
  uint32 code = 1;
  string msg = 2;
}

message StartRecordRsp {
  CommonRsp common_rsp = 1;
  string filefolder = 2;
}

service RecordPlaybackService {
  // ...
  rpc StartRecord(StartRecordReq) returns (StartRecordRsp);
  // ...
}
```


Developers can fill in the following parameters in the request package `StartRecordReq`:
- `action_name`: The name of the record action to be started;
- `preparation_duration_s`: The time to look back and record when the request is received, in seconds. The maximum cannot exceed the `max_preparation_duration_s` value configured in the action;
- `record_duration_s`: The duration of the recording, in seconds. If it is 0, it will keep recording until the process stops;


Below is an example of calling this interface via HTTP using the curl tool, based on the http RPC backend in **net_plugin**:

```shell
data='{
    "action_name": "my_signal_record",
    "preparation_duration_s": 5,
    "record_duration_s": 10
}'

curl -i \
    -H 'content-type:application/json' \
    -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:50080/rpc/aimrt.protocols.record_playback_plugin.RecordPlaybackService/StartRecord' \
    -d "$data"
```


This example command can start a record action named `my_signal_record`, looking back and recording 5s of data, with a recording duration of 10s. If the call is successful, the command returns the following, where `filefolder` indicates the folder path where the data is saved:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 19

{
  "common_rsp": {
    "code": 0,
    "msg": ""
  },
  "filefolder": "/path/to/record/aimrtbag_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS"
}
```



### StopRecord

The `StopRecord` interface is used to stop a running signal-mode record action. Its interface definition is as follows:

```proto
message StopRecordReq {
  string action_name = 1;
}

message CommonRsp {
  uint32 code = 1;
  string msg = 2;
}

service RecordPlaybackService {
  // ...
  rpc StopRecord(StopRecordReq) returns (CommonRsp);
  // ...
}
```


Developers can fill in the following parameters in the request package `StartRecordReq`:
- `action_name`: The name of the record action to be stopped;


Below is an example of calling this interface via HTTP using the curl tool, based on the http RPC backend in **net_plugin**:

```shell
data='{
    "action_name": "my_signal_record"
}'

curl -i \
    -H 'content-type:application/json' \
    -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:50080/rpc/aimrt.protocols.record_playback_plugin.RecordPlaybackService/StopRecord' \
    -d "$data"
```


This example command can stop the record action named `my_signal_record`. If the call is successful, the command returns the following:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 19

{"code":0,"msg":""}
```



### StartPlayback


The `StartPlayback` interface is used to start a signal-mode playback action. Its interface definition is as follows:

```proto
message StartPlaybackReq {
  string action_name = 1;
  uint32 skip_duration_s = 2;
  uint32 play_duration_s = 3;  // playback to end if value is 0
}

message CommonRsp {
  uint32 code = 1;
  string msg = 2;
}

service RecordPlaybackService {
  // ...
  rpc StartPlayback(StartPlaybackReq) returns (CommonRsp);
  // ...
}
```


Developers can fill in the following parameters in the request package `StartPlaybackReq`:
- `action_name`: The name of the playback action to be started;
- `skip_duration_s`: The time to skip, in seconds;
- `play_duration_s`: The duration of the playback, in seconds;


Below is an example of calling this interface via HTTP using the curl tool, based on the http RPC backend in **net_plugin**:

```shell
data='{
    "action_name": "my_signal_playback",
    "skip_duration_s": 5,
    "play_duration_s": 10
}'

curl -i \
    -H 'content-type:application/json' \
    -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:50080/rpc/aimrt.protocols.record_playback_plugin.RecordPlaybackService/StartPlayback' \
    -d "$data"
```


This example command can start a playback action named `my_signal_playback`, skipping 5s of data, with a playback duration of 10s. If the call is successful, the command returns the following:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 19

{"code":0,"msg":""}
```
### StopPlayback

The `StopPlayback` interface is used to stop a running playback action in signal mode. Its interface definition is as follows:

```proto
message StopPlaybackReq {
  string action_name = 1;
}

message CommonRsp {
  uint32 code = 1;
  string msg = 2;
}

service RecordPlaybackService {
  // ...
  rpc StopPlayback(StopPlaybackReq) returns (CommonRsp);
  // ...
}
```


Developers can fill in the following parameters in the request package `StopPlaybackReq`:
- `action_name`: the name of the playback action to be stopped;

Below is an example of calling this interface via HTTP using the curl tool, based on the http RPC backend in **net_plugin**:

```shell
data='{
    "action_name": "my_signal_playback"
}'

curl -i \
    -H 'content-type:application/json' \
    -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:50080/rpc/aimrt.protocols.record_playback_plugin.RecordPlaybackService/StopPlayback' \
    -d "$data"
```


This example command stops the playback action named `my_signal_playback`. If the call succeeds, the command returns the following:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 19

{"code":0,"msg":""}
```


### UpdateMetadata

The `UpdateMetadata` interface is used to update custom metadata (extra attributes) associated with a specified record action. This interface is not limited to any recording mode. Its interface definition is as follows:


```proto
message UpdateMetadataReq {
  string action_name = 1;
  map<string, string> kv_pairs = 2;
}

service RecordPlaybackService {
  // ...
  rpc UpdateMetadata(UpdateMetadataReq) returns (CommonRsp);
  // ...
}
```


Developers can fill in the following parameters in the request package `UpdateMetadataReq`:
- `action_name`: the name of the record action to be updated;
- `kv_pairs`: a map containing the metadata key-value pairs to be updated or added.
  - `key`: the name of the metadata. Note: when the key is an empty string, the key-value pair will be ignored; when keys are duplicated, only the last updated value is kept.
  - `value`: the value of the metadata. The server-side implementation of this interface will attempt to parse each value string as YAML:
    * If parsing succeeds, the value string is treated as valid YAML data. The parsed YAML structure (which may be a Map, List, or simple scalar such as string, number, boolean, etc.) will be stored as the metadata item. This means you can pass a serialized complex YAML structure string, and it will be stored as the corresponding structured data.
    * If parsing fails, the system will catch the parsing exception and store the original value string itself as a plain text string as the metadata item.

Below is an example of calling this interface via HTTP using the curl tool, based on the http RPC backend in **net_plugin**:

```shell
data='{
    "action_name": "my_signal_record",
    "kv_pairs":{ "key": "timestamp: '2023-10-25T12:34:56.789Z'\nposition:\n  x: 1.2\n  y: 3.4\n  z: 0.0\norientation:\n  roll: 0.0\n  pitch: 0.0\n  yaw: 1.57\nsensor_temperature: 25.5C\nsensor_distance_front: 1.8m\nbattery_voltage: 12.4V\nbattery_level: 85%\nmotor_speed_left: 100rpm\nmotor_speed_right: 102rpm\nstatus: active\nmode: autonomous\nlog_message: Navigation started."}
}'
curl -i \
    -H 'content-type:application/json' \
    -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:50080/rpc/aimrt.protocols.record_playback_plugin.RecordPlaybackService/UpdateMetadata' \
    -d "$data"

```

This example command updates the metadata of the record action named `my_signal_record`. If the call succeeds, the command returns the following:


```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 19

{"code":0,"msg":""}
```
